<p>3.)make folders named: routes , controllers , views , middlewares , models , service</p>
<p>4.)we will 1st start working in model folder ; we will require mongoose here and then assign schema variable = new mongoose.Schema({ 
//our schema });</p><br>
<p>then we will create a model (momgoose.model) give it some name and export that variable of model</p><br>
<p>5.) now we will start working in routes folder</p><br>
<p>firstly , we will require express here and assign router variable to express.Router()</p><br>
<p>how we will make all the routes we have to make for eg: router.post('/')</p>
<br>
<p>now we will go in controllers folder and make async functions for our routes and then import that into the routes folder </p>
<br><p>import the routes folder in index.js and do app.use for that variable </p>
